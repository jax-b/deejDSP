# deejdsp
## This is a deej project that uses custom written plugins to support displays!
This uses my modifed fork of deej which is at v0.9.6-pre3. This is still in the development phase but expect to see a more finished version soon!

You will also need a sd card adapter in order to store your images. This can be scaled from two to eight of sliders and displays. With some work it can also be scalled far beyond.
