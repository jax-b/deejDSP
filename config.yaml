# Only one image can be set per display mapping 
# Keep it to 8 characters not including the extention to fit in the arduino SD library
# You can specify a custom name, auto or nothing
# auto: automatically generate a image from current mapped session to slider
#       if you dont like the generated image you can make your own place a image file on the sd card with the name of the program
#       auto will still map the image with the same name as the current session on that slider (only matches the first 8 char)
# Custom Name: sends that name directly to the screen
# Nothing: turns off the display
